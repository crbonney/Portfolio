# Node.js Discord Bots

This showcases two of the chat bots I wrote with the Discord API using Node.js. 

### Legendarium Bot
This bot is an ongoing project I've maintained since 2017. It showcases use of APIs, regex parsing, automated tasks, and user interactions. 

### RPG Bot
This bot was used to help manage a "Westmarch D&D Campaign", an open-to-all Dungeons and Dragons group with multiple game masters where you sign up for individual sessions, or "quests", only when you have time with no weekly commitments. It showcases use of SQL cloud database management and regex parsing.
