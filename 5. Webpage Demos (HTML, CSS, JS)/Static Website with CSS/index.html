            <a href="https://www.nps.gov/jotr/index.htm" target="_blank">Joshua Tree National Park</a>: "Tree National Park, located in southern California, is part of the National Park Service, within the Department of the Interior. The almost 800,000-acre (323,749 ha) park covers an area larger than the state of Rhode Island. It is located 140 miles (225 km) east of Los Angeles, California on the west coast of the United States. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt designated the area as a national monument in 1936. Joshua Tree was elevated to national park status in 1994. Each year, over 3 million visitors come to enjoy the unique experiences that only can be had at Joshua Tree.
<br><br>
Two distinct desert ecosystems, the Mojave, and the Colorado, come together in Joshua Tree National Park. A fascinating variety of plants and animals make their homes in a land sculpted by strong winds and occasional torrents of rain. Dark night skies, a rich cultural history, and surreal geologic features add to the wonder of this vast wilderness in southern California. Come explore for yourself!"
