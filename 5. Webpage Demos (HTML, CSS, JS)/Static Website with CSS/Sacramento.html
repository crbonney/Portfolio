The Capitol building serves as both a museum and the state’s working seat of government.  The building houses the chambers of the California State Legislature, made up of the California State Assembly and the California State Senate, along with the office of the Governor of California.  Visitors to the Capitol can at once experience California’s rich history and witness the making of history through the modern lawmaking process."</p></td>

It also serves the citizens of California as the State's official reception center for leaders from around the world. Leland Stanford became the 8th Governor of California and set up his gubernatorial office at this Sacramento Mansion in 1862. The Leland Stanford Mansion is a stunning example of the splendor and elegance of the Victorian era in California."</p></td>
