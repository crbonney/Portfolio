# Webpage Demos

This includes 3 demo pages, showcasing different components that can be combined as desired to create a web app suitable for a variety of needs.

1. Static Webpage with CSS: A simple set of interconnected webpages with internal linking and flexible CSS as a demo of a front-facing homepage.
2. Dynamic Webpage Elements: A demo page showing dynamic HTML editing with JS, including using local storage to store items on a simple TODO list.
3. Animated Canvas: A demo page of using JS to create animated elements. In this case, a demo of the inertial and non-inertial perspectives of an object being thrown in a rotating room.
