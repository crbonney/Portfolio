# Projects and Work

This repository shows many of the work and projects I completed in school, as well as some personal projects. The majority of my work is in Python, MATLAB and JavaScript. 

A brief description of the folders:

1. Control Engineering (MATLAB): Samples of technical mathematical analysis and data processing in various topics of Control Theory and Systems Engineering. Includes work on Robotic arms, Quadcopter modeling and control, and a set of analysis tools to create and analyze controllers for a generic system.
2. Computer Vision (Python): Work from a computer vision class, contains implementations of image processing algorithms, as well as some of the mathematical background for the algorithms.
3. Advent of Code (Python): Coding challenges of technical data processing algorithms from text and CSV file inputs.
4. Discord Bots (Node.js): Examples of chat-bots I wrote for Discord servers that perform tasks including API calls, database management, and simple web scraping.
5. Webpages (HTML, CSS, JS): Webpage demos of HTML, CSS and interactable, dynamic JS.
