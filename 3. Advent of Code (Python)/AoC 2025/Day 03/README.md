## Input:
A line-seperated set integers. Ex:
```
123543444
443233459
982111111
```

## Part 1:
For each integer in the set, determine the largest number it is possible to make from picking out two numbers scanning left-to-right. Ex: from the set above, we would get
```
54
59
98
```

## Part 2:
Repeat part 1, except pick the largest possible number using *12* digits from each row (actual puzzle input has far more than 12 digits per row).
