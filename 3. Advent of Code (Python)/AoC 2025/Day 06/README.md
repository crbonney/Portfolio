*Difficult to describe succinctly, see [the puzzle's page](https://adventofcode.com/2025/day/6) for a full description of the puzzle.*

## Input:

`N` line-seperated sets of numbers, placed in columns with a blank space between, followed by a row of operators (`*` or `+`) for each column (with odd alignment - relevant in part 2). EX:

```
123 133    3 55
31   11  222 9
2    20    8 2
*   +   *   *
```

## Part 1:
Perform the operation shown in each vertical column, (123\*31\*2, 33+1+20, ...).


## Part 2:
Now do the same, but reading each set of numbers *vertically* instead of *horizontally* (132\*21\*3, 1+312+310, 2\*2\*328, ...)
