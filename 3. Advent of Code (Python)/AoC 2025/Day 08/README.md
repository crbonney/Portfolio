## Input:

A line-seperated set of comma-seperated 3D coordinates. EX:
```
123,222,45
12,34,55
19,969,2222
```

## Part 1:
Determine the set of `N` pairs of points that have the least distance between them. Then, connect those `N` pairs, and determine the size of the connected graphs that process makes. 


## Part 2:
Determine how many closest-pair connections must be made to connect every point in the data set.
