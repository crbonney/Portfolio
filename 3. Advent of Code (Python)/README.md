# Advent of Code

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an annually released set of programming/algorithmic data analysis puzzles released each year in December, showcasing critical thinking skills, logical programming, and applied mathematics. They look simple for small input sets, but can be very difficult for the large input sets given and their edge cases.

These are my solutions to the majority of the [2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024) and currently released [2025](https://adventofcode.com/2025) puzzles. For the 2025 puzzles, I provide a brief description of each puzzle in its folder alongside the code.
