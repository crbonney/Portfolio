# Controls

This folder contains projects and assignments from the various controls classes I've taken, and some work I've done independently. They focus on the technical math and engineering. The table below provides a brief description of each subfolder:

1. Controller Design: This folder contains design and analysis tools I wrote to build feedback controllers with chosen parameters, and analyze their performance. The tools were designed to be flexible and allow for analysis of any linear system of up to 4 variables.

2. Robotics: This folder combines the work from two robotics classes of creating physical models and simulations of robotic arms, and building controllers for them.

3. Systems Lab - Quadcopter Controller: This folder contains work from an Systems application lab where I derived the dynamics of the quadcopter, created a nonlinear physical simulation, and then created controllers for hover, flipping, and path following.
